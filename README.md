# RTK Query React Project

This project is built using **React** and **Redux Toolkit Query (RTK Query)** to handle server-side data fetching and caching with efficient state management.

## Features

- **RTK Query** for simplified API requests, caching, and automatic updates.
- **Redux** integration for centralized state management.
- Optimized data fetching with caching to avoid redundant network requests.
- Handles loading states, error states, and refetching out of the box.
- Scalable project structure using hooks and middleware.
